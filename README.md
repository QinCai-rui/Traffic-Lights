# Traffic Lights

By QinCai, https://qincai.xyz

## Description
This is a simple hardware traffic lights controller. It has one green light, one yellow light, and one red light, with pedestrian crossing work-in-progress. 

## How to Use
1. Head your browser to https://wokwi.com/projects/407257111263595521 and press the green circle with a triangle inside! The emulation might be slow, and the timer might not work properly, depending on the device you are using.
2. Yup that's it!

## Features
1. Wokwi simulation right here, in your browser (and free!)
2. Red LED
3. Yellow LED
4. Green LED
5. Button for the pedestrian crossing feature (WIP)
6. Powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico W

## Requirements
1. A modern browser
2. A considerably fast computer of some kind (so that the emulation doesn't crash itself or your browser!)
3. You thought there was something else? No, that's it!

## Installation
1. A modern browser if you don't have one (which is highly unlikely because you are reading this...)
2. Just head type https://wokwi.com/projects/407257111263595521 into your browser and press the green circle with a triangle in it to start using the traffic lights!
